# EBOB-EKOK

With Java, we write programs that find Ebob and Ekok values of two numbers.

EBOB: The largest of the common divisors of two or more natural numbers is called EBOB.

Example: Let's find the biggest common divisor of 18 and 24.

18's divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

Divisions of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24

The largest number of these common divisors is EBOB.

Ekok: The smallest of the common floors of two or more natural numbers is called Ekok, the smallest common floor of these numbers.

Example: Let's find the smallest common floor of the numbers 6 and 8 step by step.

6, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48,…

8, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64,…

The smallest number of these common floors is EKOK.

Ekok = (n1*n2) / ebob

Write the EBOB and EKOK values of the two numbers with Java using the "While Cycle".
